# C-Programs
Simple programs that illustrate C language/Systems fundamentals.

## Typing Word Game
Test your typing speed on common words. Dynamic allocation tested with valgrind output for run-time objects.

## Unsigned Short Tests
This program sets certain bits in an unsigned short depending on the positions indicated my arguments to the the program. It produces an output in binary form using the printBits 
function that checks for a turned on bit at each of the 16 positions in the unsigned short.

## IEEE 754 Float Parsing
This program converts an IEEE 754 float object to its decimal equivalent taking into account the exponent, mantissa and decimal.

## Funtion Pointer Testing
This program uses function pointers to manage a dispatch table that performs simple calculations on decimal, hexadecimal and binary format program arguments.
